                        <h2>Magic Kingdom</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Magic Kingdom was the first theme park in the Disney World complex. And when you visit, it is a must that you take a picture of Cinderella's Castle. I like it at night.

                        <h2>Epcot</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Epcot is famous for its big ball, which is actually an attraction called Spaceship Earth. One of my favorite places in Disney is the Epcot attraction Living with the Land.
                        It is a green house and a fish farm.

                    </a>
                    <p>If you like to be apart of movies, Hollywood Studios is your place. One of my favorite rides is the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith.

                    <p>It's Tough to be a Bug! is a fun attraction in Disney. The best part is that you get a real life experience in the interactive theater. What do I mean by real life?
                        When you are in the theater you might feel a bug crawl or get water squirted at you. It's all apart of the bug life.
